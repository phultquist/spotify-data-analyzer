# Spotify Data
## About
This is a NodeJS application built with plotly to examine spotify data.

I didn't want to include my own data for privacy reasons, but below is how to get your own data.

Additionally, you'll need to [sign up for a plotly account](https://plot.ly)

## Getting Data
### Start with Spotify
Get your data at the [Spotify Data Download](https://www.spotify.com/account/privacy/?_ga=2.233093788.387388179.1594171524-664249325.1592970651) Site

### Add Data
Copy the data into the ```./spotify-data``` directory.

## Add Credentials
open ```creds.json.example```, add your own credentials, then **rename the file** to ```creds.json``` to perfect the code.

## Run the Code
Run ```node index.js``` to start!
